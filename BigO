Time Complexity:
Machine Independent
Rate of time taken respect to input size
Measured usually with O - Worst Case Scenario

Computing Big O:
Count operations for worst case
Ignore Constants
Drop the lower order terms

Space Complexity:
Auxillary Space + Input Space
Auxillary Space is the space/memory used for solving.
Avoid modifying the input space in general.
